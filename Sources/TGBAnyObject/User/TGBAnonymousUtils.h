/*!
 Provides utility functions for working with Anonymously logged-in users.  Anonymous users have some unique characteristics:
 <ul>
   <li>Anonymous users don't need a user name or password.</li>
   <li>Once logged out, an anonymous user cannot be recovered.</li>
   <li>When the current user is anonymous, the following methods can be used to switch to a different user or convert the
     anonymous user into a regular one:
     <ul>
       <li>signUp converts an anonymous user to a standard user with the given username and password.
           Data associated with the anonymous user is retained.</li>
       <li>logIn switches users without converting the anonymous user.  Data associated with the anonymous user will be lost.</li>
       <li>Service logIn (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) will attempt to convert the anonymous user into a standard user by linking it to the service.
           If a user already exists that is linked to the service, it will instead switch to the existing user.</li>
       <li>Service linking (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) will convert the anonymous user into a standard user by linking it to the service.</li>
     </ul>
 </ul>
