 <h3>Subclassing Notes</h3>
 
 Developers can subclass TGBObject for a more native object-oriented class structure. Strongly-typed subclasses of TGBObject must conform to the TGBSubclassing protocol and must call registerSubclass to be returned by TGBQuery and other TGBObject factories. All methods in TGBSubclassing except for [TGBSubclassing parseClassName] are already implemented in the TGBObject(Subclass) category. Inculding TGBObject+Subclass.h in your implementation file provides these implementations automatically.
 
 Subclasses support simpler initializers, query syntax, and dynamic synthesizers.

/*!
 Creates an instance of the registered subclass with this class's parseClassName.
 This helps a subclass ensure that it can be subclassed itself. For example, [TGBUsered object] will
 return a MyUser object if MyUser is a registered subclass of TGBUsered. For this reason, [MyClass object] is
 preferred to [[MyClass alloc] init].
 This method can only be called on subclasses which conform to TGBSubclassing.
 A default implementation is provided by TGBObject which should always be sufficient.

 Registers an Objective-C class for LeanCloud to use for representing a given LeanCloud class.
